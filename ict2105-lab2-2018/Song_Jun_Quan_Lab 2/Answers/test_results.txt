Test 1:

onCreate() calls: 1
onStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

The reason why onRestart doesn't increase because it's not restarted.

Test 2:

onCreate() calls: 1
onStart() calls: 2
onResume() calls: 2
onRestart() calls: 1

For this test, onCreate doesn't increase because it's not created butinstead, it's being restarted which means onStart, onResume and onRestart will be activiated.

Test 3:

onCreate() calls: 3
onStart() calls: 3
onResume() calls: 3
onRestart() calls: 0

For this test, onCreate, onStart and onResume will be activiated because when being rotated, it's being created in another screen layout thus calls these functions.

Test 4:

onCreate() calls: 1
onStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

For this test, onCreate, onStart and onResume will be activiated because the new activity is being started.

Test 5:

onCreate() calls: 3
onStart() calls: 3
onResume() calls: 3
onRestart() calls: 0

This test is the same as test case 1 just that this is in a new activity

Test 6:

onCreate() calls: 1
onStart() calls: 2
onResume() calls: 2
onRestart() calls: 1

For this test case, All will be activiated due to the reason that activity 2 is being closed and will return to activity 1 which leads to the restart of the activity thus everything is activiated for this case.

Test 7:

onCreate() calls: 1
onStart() calls: 1
onResume() calls: 1
onRestart() calls: 0

The reason for the result is because the new activity is being started.
